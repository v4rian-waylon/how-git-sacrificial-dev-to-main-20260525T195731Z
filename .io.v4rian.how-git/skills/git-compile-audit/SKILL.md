description: Compile-only verification per (zip × repo). Node services run npm install + node --check; Qt libs run cmake build of static lib target; Qt apps run cmake build of app target, with adjacent lib clones resolved to the latest preflight whose date is ≤ the zip's date for historical accuracy. Invoke from git-snapshots steps 4 and 5; complements git-runtime-audit.

# git-compile-audit — compile-only verification

**STATUS:** deterministic enforcement moved to async CI. As of the Step 2 lifecycle redesign (`pool/n33`), the synchronous claude pass at `pre-push` time is dropped. The compile audit now runs asynchronously on every pushed branch via `.github/workflows/audit-pushed-branch.yml` and surfaces as the `compile` required status check on PRs to dev. Compile-and-test belongs on CI hardware, not on the developer's laptop. The recipes below remain the authoritative reference for the workflow script and for local diagnostic runs.

Coverage proves the source content matches the zip. Compile proves the source parses + links. Runtime extends that with boot/launch. This skill is the compile layer specifically — no runtime side effects, no process launches.

## Repo type → compile recipe

### Node services (cmna, cloud-site, website)

```bash
cd <repo>
npm install --silent --no-audit --no-fund
# Walk every JS outside node_modules/build, run node --check
find . -name '*.js' -not -path './node_modules/*' -not -path './build*' -print0 \
  | xargs -0 -I{} node --check {}
```

Pass criterion: every staged JS parses; `npm install` resolves the dependency tree.

### Qt static libs (native-base, native-auth, native-ui)

```bash
cd <repo>
rm -rf build
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build --parallel
ls build/lib<Name>.a       # static lib linked
ls build/<Name>/lib<Name>plugin.a    # QML module plugin linked
```

Pass criterion: cmake configure succeeds; ninja build emits the static lib + QML plugin lib.

### Qt apps (native-app, native-admin, native-guest)

Qt apps' CMakeLists uses `add_subdirectory(../native-base ...)` etc. — relative paths to adjacent lib repos. This means the app's compile environment needs all 3 lib repos at adjacent paths.

**Historical accuracy rule**: when compiling the app at zip N's preflight, use the LATEST preflight of each lib repo whose date is ≤ zip N's date. This reproduces the lib surface at zip N's moment.

```python
# Pseudocode for adjacent-path setup
def setup_qt_app_workspace(app_repo, app_branch, zip_date):
    ws = f"/tmp/compile/{app_repo}-{app_branch}-ws"
    # Clone the app at its preflight
    git_clone(f"--branch {app_branch} --single-branch",
              f"https://github.com/sessionpass/{app_repo}.git",
              f"{ws}/{app_repo}")
    # Clone each lib at its latest preflight ≤ zip_date
    for lib in ("native-base", "native-auth", "native-ui"):
        lib_branches = git_ls_remote_pf(lib)  # all preflight-bak-* on origin
        eligible = [b for b in lib_branches if branch_date(b) <= zip_date]
        latest = max(eligible)  # latest ≤ zip date
        git_clone(f"--branch {latest} --single-branch",
                  f"https://github.com/sessionpass/{lib}.git",
                  f"{ws}/{lib}")
    return ws
```

Then compile the app:

```bash
cd <ws>/<app_repo>
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build --parallel
ls build/*.app
```

Pass criterion: `<app>.app` bundle is emitted at `build/<Name>.app`.

## Per-zip-per-repo coverage

`git-snapshots` invokes compile-audit at:

- **Step 4** (after each `[MERGE] feature/X into dev`): compile the dev tip.
- **Step 5** (after `[MERGE] dev into main` at zip close): compile main tip.

Save build logs to `/tmp/compile/<repo>-<zip-date>.log`. The log is the audit trail.

## Failure handling

- `cmake -S . -B build` failure: usually a CMakeLists path issue or a missing lib at adjacent path. Verify the lib preflight clones are correctly placed.
- `node --check` failure: syntax error in the staged file. Investigate which atomic commit introduced it; amend.
- `npm install` failure: missing dep in `package.json`, or a corrupted `package-lock.json`. Compare with the zip's `package-lock.json`.
- Qt app `cmake --build` failure: usually an API drift between the app and its lib deps. Confirm you picked the right preflight date for each lib.

## Parallelism

Compile checks can run 4-way parallel via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Each Qt build is ~1-3 min; each Node check is ~30-60 sec. With 4 workers and 119 (zip × repo) pairs, a full chain compile sweep is ~90-120 min.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed

def compile_one(repo, branch, zip_date):
    if repo in NODE_SERVICES:
        return check_node(repo, branch)
    elif repo in QT_LIBS:
        return check_qt_lib(repo, branch)
    elif repo in QT_APPS:
        ws = setup_qt_app_workspace(repo, branch, zip_date)
        return check_qt_app(ws, repo)

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as ex:
    futures = {ex.submit(compile_one, r, b, d): (r, b)
               for (r, b, d) in inventory}
    for fut in as_completed(futures):
        ...
```

## Banned shortcuts

- Compiling Qt apps without adjacent lib repos at the matching-date preflight — produces inaccurate "what did this look like at this zip" data.
- Skipping `npm install` because `node_modules` happens to be on disk — the install step verifies `package-lock.json` is consistent.
- Treating cmake warnings as failures (or vice versa) — only `cmake --build` returncode matters.
