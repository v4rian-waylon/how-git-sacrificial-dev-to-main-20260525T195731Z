# git-snapshots — chain-of-zip rebuild orchestrator (project-agnostic)

You reconstruct atomic git history from a chain of bak zip snapshots into a real repo on a git host. The output git log must read like normal disciplined development — no reference to zips, no rebuild language, no fabrication.

## Scope determination (FIRST step, every invocation)

Before any work, determine the scope. Infer when possible; ask once when not.

### What scope means

- **Workspace root**: the directory containing the repos (e.g. `<workspace>`).
- **Bak dir**: where the zip chain lives (e.g. `<workspace>/baks/`).
- **Mirror dir**: where the auto-synced shuttle lives (e.g. `<workspace>/shuttle.o/`); optional.
- **In-scope repos**: the subset of subdirs under workspace that are real git repos to operate on. Some workspaces may exclude specific repos.
- **Identity**: `user.name` and `user.email` to author commits as. Read from the working repo's `git config` — never hardcode.

### Inference rules (try in order)

1. If the user named a workspace path in conversation, use it.
2. If the current working directory contains multiple `.git/` subdirs at one level deep, that directory is the workspace.
3. If the workspace contains a `baks/`, `bak/`, or `BAK*/` subdir with `*.zip` files inside, that is the bak dir.
4. Look for project-level guidance: `<workspace>/CLAUDE.md` often lists in-scope repos and exceptions.

### Explicit ask (only if inference fails)

If any of the four scope items can't be inferred, ask ONCE upfront via `AskUserQuestion`:

```
"Confirm zip rebuild scope:
  - Workspace root: <inferred or empty>
  - Bak dir: <inferred or empty>
  - Repos in scope (comma list): <inferred or empty>
  - Repos to exclude (comma list): <empty>"
```

After this single ask, **never prompt the user again** during the rebuild. All subsequent actions execute under the established scope.

## Reversibility — no permission prompts mid-flow

The user does not get interrupted with permission asks during execution. Instead, every destructive action is preceded by a safety snapshot so any rejection rolls back cleanly.

### Safety snapshot pattern

Before any of: `git push --force[-with-lease]`, `git push origin --delete`, `git reset --hard`, `git filter-branch`, `git rebase`:

1. Tag the current state of each affected branch as a local safety branch:
   ```bash
   TS=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)
   for branch in main dev <feature/*>; do
     git branch "safety/${branch//\//_}-$TS" "$branch" 2>/dev/null
   done
   ```
2. Push every safety branch to origin BEFORE the destructive operation:
   ```bash
   git push origin "safety/...-$TS"
   ```
3. Execute the destructive operation.

If the user signals rejection (`stop`, `revert`, `undo`, `roll back`), restore from the latest safety branches:

```bash
TS=<the last safety timestamp>
git push --force origin "safety/main-$TS:refs/heads/main"
git push --force origin "safety/dev-$TS:refs/heads/dev"
# etc per affected branch
```

### Safety branch cleanup

After the user explicitly confirms the rebuild result is acceptable (or after a configurable retention window), safety branches can be deleted:

```bash
git push origin --delete safety/...-$TS
git branch -D safety/...-$TS
```

Until that confirmation, safety branches are preserved on origin AND locally.

### Operations that are NOT reversible

A few operations can't be undone — these are the only cases where the skill explicitly asks before proceeding (and the ask is genuine, not effort-saving):

- Deleting a remote repository entirely via API (`DELETE /repos/...`). No git-level recovery.
- Force-pushing a branch the user wants kept that has no safety snapshot (only on operator error).

When such an irreversible operation is needed, surface a `Confirm IRREVERSIBLE: ...` ask via `AskUserQuestion`. Otherwise, proceed.

## Canonical per-zip sequence

For each zip N in chronological order (oldest first):

### Step 0 — Read inputs
- Extract the zip to `/tmp/zip<N>/` preserving mtimes (`unzip` does this by default).
- Identify which in-scope repos the zip touches (top-level dir or nested wrapper).
- Compute the zip's date for naming: `date -r <zip_path> +%Y-%m-%d`, with letter suffix (`a`, `b`, ...) for same-date collisions.

### Step 1 — Safety snapshot + preflight
- Tag current `main` + `dev` of every affected repo as safety branches and push.
- Invoke `git-snapshot-preflight` per affected repo (one preflight per zip × repo).
- Preflight pushes to origin BEFORE any rebuild commit.

### Step 2 — Plan strategy
- Invoke `git-strategy-audit` — map the diff (zip N vs zip N-1) into atomic feature topics; decide single-commit-to-dev vs feature-branch; plan README touches.

### Step 3 — Apply commits atomically
- For each commit, invoke `git-commit-audit` (Section IX lens) before composing the message.
- Date rule: both `GIT_AUTHOR_DATE` + `GIT_COMMITTER_DATE` = latest mtime of staged subset.
- Description paragraph (1-3 sentences) opens body.
- `[NEW]` reserved for genuinely new files / classes / subsystems.

### Step 4 — Verify after every feature merge into dev
- `git-merge-audit` for the merge.
- `git-coverage-audit` (binary diff vs zip extract).
- `git-compile-audit` (compile pass).
- `git-runtime-audit` (boot/launch pass).
- Any failure → reset to safety branch + investigate.

### Step 5 — Close the zip with dev → main
- `git-merge-audit` for `[MERGE] dev into main`.
- Run all three audits again against the post-merge main.

### Step 6 — Push (force-with-lease only)
- `git push --force-with-lease origin main dev <feature-branches>`.
- Never `--force` without `--with-lease`; never include `preflight-bak-*` in the push set after initial preflight push.

### Step 7 — Move to zip N+1
- Archive the zip from canonical bak dir to `<mirror>/baks/archived/` only after every check passes.
- Do not delete the most recent zip in the chain — it is the rollback.
- Safety branches from this zip remain available until the user confirms acceptance of the next zip's outcome.

## Blank repo state

For repos that are intentionally empty (new or wiped), force-push an orphan commit with an empty tree and an empty commit message to `main`. No tombstone wording, no `Initial` title, no descriptive subject. The user does not get prompted; the rewrite executes against the safety-snapshot pattern so it remains reversible.

See `git-history-rewrite` Mechanic 3 for the exact commands.

## Cross-cutting governance (read first, every invocation)

1. **Saved memory and skills are binding.** Read `MEMORY.md` and every skill linked from `CLAUDE.md` before composing any commit or dispatching any sub-agent.
2. **Apply every learned rule on the FIRST pass.** Sub-agents get every applicable rule inline or a skill pointer.
3. **Active-monitor background agents.** Never sit idle while agents run; watch their git refs and intervene before push if violations surface.
4. **Never ask effort-saving questions.** The user's instruction is the thorough path.
5. **Never touch user-authored commits without authorization.** See `git-history-preservation`.
