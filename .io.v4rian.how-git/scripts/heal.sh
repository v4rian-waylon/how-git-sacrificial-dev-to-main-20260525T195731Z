#!/usr/bin/env bash
# heal.sh - restore the template's expected state when something has drifted.
#
# Not a first-time-install requirement. The template works out of the box -
# in-repo scripts auto-activate hooks on first run, VERSION is lazily inited,
# git preserves executable bits. heal.sh is for REPAIR:
#
#   - core.hooksPath has drifted (overwritten by another tool or another repo
#     config edit) → reasserts .io.v4rian.how-git/githooks.
#   - a hook or script lost its executable bit (rare, but possible if a tool
#     copied files without preserving mode, or a tarball was extracted without
#     -p) → re-chmods all the executables shipped by the template.
#
# heal.sh DOES NOT touch VERSION anymore. Tags are the canonical version
# state; there is no live VERSION file at repo root. For runtime/build
# identifiers on unmerged work, use `.io.v4rian.how-git/bin/version`.
#
# Idempotent and safe to run repeatedly. Surfaces what it changed and what
# was already correct.
#
# Usage:
#   heal.sh                 do the heal
#   heal.sh --dry-run       show what would be changed, no mutations
#   heal.sh -h | --help     print this help
