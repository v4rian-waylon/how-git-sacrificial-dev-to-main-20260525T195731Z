# audits/runtime.sh - deterministic runtime boot verification for the
# pushed branch. Invoked by .github/workflows/audit-pushed-branch.yml as
# one of the three required status checks on PRs to dev.
#
# Consumer projects override this script with their actual runtime smoke
# (boot the service, hit a health endpoint, scan for the expected init
# markers in the log). The template ships a placeholder that exits
# clean for content-only repos and defers to the consumer otherwise.
#
# Contract:
#   - Exit 0 when the service boots and prints its expected init markers.
#   - Exit non-zero when the boot crashes or the init markers are missing,
#     with the failing process's stderr surfaced in the workflow log.
