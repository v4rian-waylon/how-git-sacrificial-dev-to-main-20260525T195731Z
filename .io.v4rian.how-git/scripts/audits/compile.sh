# audits/compile.sh - deterministic compile-only verification for the pushed
# branch. Invoked by .github/workflows/audit-pushed-branch.yml as one of
# the three required status checks on PRs to dev.
#
# Consumer projects override this script with their actual compile recipe
# (npm install + node --check for Node services, cmake build for Qt apps,
# etc.). The template ships a placeholder that exits with a clear message
# so misconfigured forks fail loudly instead of silently passing.
#
# Contract:
#   - Exit 0 on a passing compile.
#   - Exit non-zero on any compile failure, with the failing tool's stderr
#     surfaced in the workflow log.
#   - Touch no files outside the workspace; the workflow's actions/checkout
#     gives you a clean tree per run.
